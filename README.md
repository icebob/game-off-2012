## SuperCurve

Super Curve is a pseudo 3d game were you use a paddle to bounce a ball back at a computer controlled opponent. Think table tennis but in inside of a box. You can put a bit of curve on the ball which gives you more points and makes it more difficult for the opponent to return your shot
